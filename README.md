# Adverts Rent a Car Application

An app for a car rental company in Ukraine. Routes are made in the application:

- "/" - the home page with a general description of the services provided by the
  company
- "/catalogue" - a page containing a catalogue of cars of various configurations
- "/favorites" - a page with ads that have been added to the user's favorites If
  the user visits a route that does not exist, he or she should be redirected to
  the home page.

To work with the list of ads, we created a backend for development using the UI
service https://mockapi.io/.

This project was created with the help of

- React
- Redux Tool Kit
- Redux Persist
- PropTypes
- Styled Component
- Axios
- Notiflix
- mockapi.io
